## Introduction<a name="section_HJSUnit_001"></a>

We provide a series of app samples to help you quickly get familiar with the test capabilities and how to use of the HJSUnit. Each app sample is an independent project in DevEco Studio. You can import a project into DevEco Studio to learn how to use APIs in the sample by browsing code, building the project, and installing and running the app.

## Usage<a name="section_HJSUnit_002"></a>

1.  Import an independent app sample project into DevEco Studio for compilation, building, running, and debugging.
2.  After HAP installation and execution, you can view the execution effect of the sample on the device and then conduct debugging.

## Limitations<a name="section_HJSUnit_003"></a>

Before installing and running the sample, check the  **deviceType**  field in the  **config.json**  file to obtain the device types supported by the sample. You can modify this field to enable the sample to run on your target device. \(The  **config.json**  file is generally stored in the  **entry/src/main**  directory, which may be different depending on the samples.\)
